# AdaBins

## Train

To train network `train.py` was used with arguments from `args_train_evo.txt`:

```
python train.py args_train_evo.txt
```

## Evaluate

To eval network use:

```
python evaluate.py args_test_evo.txt
```

## Inference

Inference image can be done with `infer.py` file, but we used `evaluate.py` file for it.
